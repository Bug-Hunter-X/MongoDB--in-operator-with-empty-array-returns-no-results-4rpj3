# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This example demonstrates an uncommon issue when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query returns no results even if the field exists in the documents.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage of the `$in` operator.  The query `db.collection.find({field: {$in: []}})` will always return an empty array, regardless of the data in the collection.

## Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.js` illustrates two ways to handle empty arrays in this context:

1. Check for an empty array before executing the query.
2. Use a conditional operator for more flexibility.
